Cooking Recipe
==============

Vegetable Potstickers
---------------------

### List of Ingredients:

-   1/2 pound firm tofu
-   1/2 cup coarsely grated carrots
-   1/2 cup shredded Napa cabbage
-   2 tablespoons finely chopped red pepper
-   2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions
-   2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger
-   1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves
-   2 minced cloves garlic (Deb addition)
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce
-   1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
-   2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
-   1 egg, lightly beaten
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   35 to 40 small wonton wrappers
-   1/3 cup chicken stock or water

### *Special* Kitchen Tools:

-   12-inch saute pan
-   a heatproof platter

### Steps:

1.  Preheat the oven to 200°F

2.  Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels.

3.  Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well).

4.  Let stand 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl.

5.  Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine.

6.  To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper.

7.  Heat a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat. Brush with vegetable oil once hot. Add 8 to 10 potstickers at a time to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, without touching.

8.  Once the 2 minutes are up, gently add 1/3 cup chicken stock to the pan, turn the heat down to low, cover, and cook for another 2 minutes.

9.  Remove wontons to a heatproof platter and place in the warm oven. Repeat until all the wontons are cooked.

Is there a special season of the year for it?

No.

Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients.

Yes, replacing 1 teaspoon with hot sesame oil for 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil will make it more delicious.

Euclidean Distance
==================

Definition <font size= "3"> \[edit\]
------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\mathbf{pq}}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

$$\\begin{eqnarray}d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) & = & \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\cdots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}\\\\
& = &\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}
\\end{eqnarray}\\tag{1}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\cdots+p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}$,

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
